         <p>A junior developer with a hunger for knowledge!
            As a creative, unix nerd, and devops aficionado;
            I love simple applications that optimize and simplify
            workflows. I enjoy- and prefer in person work,
            but am also comfortable working remotely.
            I am a self-starter and problem-solver with a passion
            for learning and a desire to grow in the tech industry.

            Problem solving with other team members is enjoyable,
            exciting, and fulfilling. I believe that comradary is
            an integral part of the creative and problem solving process.
            Engineering solutions to difficult or otherwise unique problems is hard to beat!</p>

         <h3>Some of my Favorite Quotes.</h3>
         <p>"You got the makings of greatness in you, but you gotta take the helm and chart your own course! Stick to
            it, no matter the squalls! And when the time comes, you'll get the chance to really test the cut of your
            sails and show what you're made of! And... well, I hope I'm there, catching some of the light coming off you
            that day." - John Silver, Treasure Planet</p>
         <p>"Not all those who wander are lost." - J.R. Tolkien</p>
         <p>"The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't
            settle." - Steve Jobs</p>
